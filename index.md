# About Me

Hi! I am Leighanna Pipatanangkura. I am currently in the overwhelming phase of preparing to apply for PhD programs in Computer Science with a focus on NLP and machine learning. I completed my BS in Computer Science and a BA in East Asian Studies with a 
a minor in Linguistics, followed by an MS in Human Language Technology at the University of Arizona. 
I am primarily interested in research as well as in roles in machine learning engineering or software development.

My primary research interests lie in Explainable AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My goal is to further explore these topics and contribute to the cutting-edge research that bridges the gap betwen AI models and human understanding. 

Outside my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy crochet, playing rythm games, and hanging with my dogs 
(Chip-Chip and Dale). 

I am eager to connect with potential advisors, collaborator, and fellow researcher. Feel free to reach out to discuss 
reearch oportunities or any exciting projects in the realm of Computer Science, AI, and NLP.
